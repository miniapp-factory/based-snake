```
I want to create a Snake game mini-app with a simple mobile-friendly interface. The game should only begin after pressing a visible 'Start' button. For controls, I need 4 buttons (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the snake, which should be made of blue blocks with a distinct head and tail. The goal is to eat fruit to grow by one block, but there must be static obstacles on the map to avoid. The game ends if the snake hits the borders, the obstacles, or itself; when the player loses, a restart button should appear, and the score must be saved to a leaderboard accessible via a specific button.
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

The following files in your repository will need to be added or edited to implement the Snake game mini‑app, the start/restart controls, the leaderboard button, and the updated app logo and metadata:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the title and description.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new file to generate the app logo.  
3. `mini-app/components/snake-game.tsx` – new component that implements the game logic, start button, control buttons, and restart button.  
4. `mini-app/components/leaderboard.tsx` – new component that displays the saved scores.  
5. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – import and render the `SnakeGame` component and add the leaderboard button.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for each.

3. `mini-app/components/leaderboard.tsx` – component to display the leaderboard.  

Once those files are added, I’ll supply the changes for `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` and `mini-app/app/page.tsx`.

#### It uses a canvas to do this  

The following files in your repository are the ones that will need to be edited or added to implement the Snake game mini‑app, the canvas rendering, the start/restart controls, the leaderboard, and the updated app logo and metadata:

1. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – import and render the new game and leaderboard components.  
2. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the title and description.  
3. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new file to generate the app logo.  
4. `mini-app/components/snake-game.tsx` – new component that implements the canvas‑based Snake game.  
5. `mini-app/components/leaderboard.tsx` – new component that displays the saved scores.  

These are the only files that will need to be changed or added for the requested functionality.
