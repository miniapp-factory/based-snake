+Code the following app
+```
+I want to create a Snake game mini-app with a simple mobile-friendly interface. The game should only begin after pressing a visible 'Start' button. For controls, I need 4 buttons (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the snake, which should be made of blue blocks with a distinct head and tail. The goal is to eat fruit to grow by one block, but there must be static obstacles on the map to avoid. The game ends if the snake hits the borders, the obstacles, or itself; when the player loses, a restart button should appear, and the score must be saved to a leaderboard accessible via a specific button.

+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
